He claims that the term \"operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues\" and that it creates a \"bias\" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to \"property rights\". Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term.", "qas": [{"question": "Who founded the Free Software Foundation?", "id": "572654c2708984140094c2af", "answers": [{"text": "Richard Stallman", "answer_start": 33}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "bias", "answer_start": 536}], "question": "What does Stallman say is created by confusing ownership with monopolies?", "id": "5a15ae7da54d42001852949e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}]}]}, {"title": "Cardinal_(Catholicism)", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title \"Cardinal\" (abbreviated Card.) after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, \"John Card(inal) Doe\" or, in Latin, \"Ioannes Card(inalis) Cognomen\". Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan, hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English. Official sources such as the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Catholic News Service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as \"Cardinal [First name] [Surname]\". This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the Catholic Church. This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences. Oriental Patriarchs who are created Cardinals customarily use \"Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis\" as their full title, probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy.", "qas": [{"question": "The Archdiocese of Milwaukee says that the correct way to address a cardinal in English is?
